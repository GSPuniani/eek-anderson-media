## About

This webapp is part of an Industry Collaboration project. The main goal for this project is to import a table of music data and create a database that will have a searchable, filterable UI so that our partner can see data analytics on his collection of music.

Add at least one code reviewer to the pull request to ensure good code quality and practice. Once the code has been approved by both the reviewer and the test pipeline. The code will be merged into production.
